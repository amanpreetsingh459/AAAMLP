        This function evaluates model on data and returns
        Area Under ROC Curve (AUC)
        NOTE: We fit the data and calculate AUC on same data.
        WE ARE OVERFITTING HERE.
        But this is also a way to achieve greedy selection.
        k-fold will take k times longer.
        If you want to implement it in really correct way,
        calculate OOF AUC and return mean AUC over k folds.
        This requires only a few lines of change and has been
        shown a few times in this book.
